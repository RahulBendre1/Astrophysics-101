# Astrophysics-101
Some algorithms I learned as part of the Awesome Duke Astronomy Course on Coursera in 2012

Highlights
* Keplertron - calculates mass of bodies based on orbital period of one of its satellites, calc orbital period based on semi-major axis
* Lorentz Transform
* Physics engine - caclulateTempAtGravitationalCollapse, calculateThermalVelocity,  calculateRadiusFromTempAndLuminosity etc
* Solar System UI Demo
